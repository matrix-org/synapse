# A dockerfile which builds a docker image for building a debian package for
# synapse. The distro to build for is passed as a docker build var.
#
# The default entrypoint expects the synapse source to be mounted as a
# (read-only) volume at /synapse/source, and an output directory at /debs.
#
# A pair of environment variables (TARGET_USERID and TARGET_GROUPID) can be
# passed to the docker container; if these are set, the build script will chown
# the build products accordingly, to avoid ending up with things owned by root
# in the host filesystem.

# Get the distro we want to pull from as a dynamic build variable

### Stage 0: build a dh-virtualenv
###

# This is only really needed on focal, since other distributions we
# care about have a recent version of dh-virtualenv by default. Unfortunately,
# it looks like focal is going to be with us for a while.
#
# (focal doesn't have a dh-virtualenv package at all. There is a PPA at
# https://launchpad.net/~jyrki-pulliainen/+archive/ubuntu/dh-virtualenv, but
# it's not obviously easier to use that than to build our own.)
