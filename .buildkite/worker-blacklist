Message history can be paginated

Can re-join room if re-invited

The only membership state included in an initial sync is for all the senders in the timeline

Local device key changes get to remote servers

If remote user leaves room we no longer receive device updates

Forgotten room messages cannot be paginated

Inbound federation can get public room list

Members from the gap are included in gappy incr LL sync

Leaves are present in non-gapped incremental syncs

Old leaves are present in gapped incremental syncs

User sees updates to presence from other users in the incremental sync.

Gapped incremental syncs include all state changes

Old members are included in gappy incr LL sync if they start speaking

# new failures as of https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/pull/732
Device list doesn't change if remote server is down
Remote servers cannot set power levels in rooms without existing powerlevels
Remote servers should reject attempts by non-creators to set the power levels

# https://buildkite.com/matrix-dot-org/synapse/builds/6134#6f67bf47-e234-474d-80e8-c6e1868b15c5
Server correctly handles incoming m.device_list_update

# this fails reliably with a torture level of 100 due to https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6536
Outbound federation requests missing prev_events and then asks for /state_ids and resolves the state

Can get rooms/{roomId}/members at a given point
