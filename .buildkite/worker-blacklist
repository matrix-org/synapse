Message history can be paginated

The only membership state included in an initial sync is for all the senders in the timeline

Local device key changes get to remote servers

If remote user leaves room we no longer receive device updates

Forgotten room messages cannot be paginated

Inbound federation can get public room list

Members from the gap are included in gappy incr LL sync

Leaves are present in non-gapped incremental syncs

Old leaves are present in gapped incremental syncs

User sees updates to presence from other users in the incremental sync.

Gapped incremental syncs include all state changes

Old members are included in gappy incr LL sync if they start speaking
