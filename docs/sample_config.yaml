# The config is maintained as an up-to-date snapshot of the default
# homeserver.yaml configuration generated by Synapse.
#
# It is intended to act as a reference for the default configuration,
# helping admins keep track of new options and other changes, and compare
# their configs with the current default.  As such, many of the actual
# config values shown are placeholders.
#
# It is *not* intended to be copied and used as the basis for a real
# homeserver.yaml. Instead, if you are starting from scratch, please generate

## Server ##

# The domain name of the server, with optional explicit port.
# This is used by remote servers to connect to this server,
# e.g. matrix.org, localhost:8080, etc.
# This is also the last part of your UserID.
#
server_name: "SERVERNAME"

# When running as a daemon, the file to store the pid in
#
pid_file: DATADIR/homeserver.pid

# CPU affinity mask. Setting this restricts the CPUs on which the
# process will be scheduled. It is represented as a bitmask, with the
# lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the
# highest order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU. Not all CPUs
# may exist on a given system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are
# present.
#
# For example:
#    0x00000001  is processor #0,
#    0x00000003  is processors #0 and #1,
#    0xFFFFFFFF  is all processors (#0 through #31).
#
# Pinning a Python process to a single CPU is desirable, because Python
# is inherently single-threaded due to the GIL, and can suffer a
# 30-40% slowdown due to cache blow-out and thread context switching
# if the scheduler happens to schedule the underlying threads across
# different cores. See
# https://www.mirantis.com/blog/improve-performance-python-programs-restricting-single-cpu/.

## TLS ##

# PEM-encoded X509 certificate for TLS.

# certificate, signed by a recognised Certificate Authority.
#
# See 'ACME support' below to enable auto-provisioning this certificate via
# Let's Encrypt.
#
# If supplying your own, be sure to use a `.pem` file that includes the
# full certificate chain including any intermediate certificates (for
# instance, if using certbot, use `fullchain.pem` as your certificate,
# not `cert.pem`).
#
#tls_certificate_path: "CONFDIR/SERVERNAME.tls.crt"

#tls_private_key_path: "CONFDIR/SERVERNAME.tls.key"

# Whether to verify TLS certificates when sending federation traffic.

#
#federation_verify_certificates: true

# Skip federation certificate verification on the following whitelist

#
# This setting should only be used in very specific cases, such as

# ACME support: This will configure Synapse to request a valid TLS certificate
# for your configured `server_name` via Let's Encrypt.
#
# Note that provisioning a certificate in this way requires port 80 to be
# routed to Synapse so that it can complete the http-01 ACME challenge.
# By default, if you enable ACME support, Synapse will attempt to listen on
# port 80 for incoming http-01 challenges - however, this will likely fail
# with 'Permission denied' or a similar error.
#
# There are a couple of potential solutions to this:
#
#  * If you already have an Apache, Nginx, or similar listening on port 80,
#    you can configure Synapse to use an alternate port, and have your web
#    server forward the requests. For example, assuming you set 'port: 8009'
#    below, on Apache, you would write:
#
#    ProxyPass /.well-known/acme-challenge http://localhost:8009/.well-known/acme-challenge
#
#  * Alternatively, you can use something like `authbind` to give Synapse
#    permission to listen on port 80.
#

    # by putting a file at 'https://<server_name>/.well-known/matrix/server',
    # you can delegate incoming traffic to another server. If you do that,
    # you should give the target of the delegation here.
    #
    # For example: if your 'server_name' is 'example.com', but
    # 'https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/server' delegates to
    # 'matrix.example.com', you should put 'matrix.example.com' here.
    #

# List of allowed TLS fingerprints for this server to publish along
# with the signing keys for this server. Other matrix servers that
# make HTTPS requests to this server will check that the TLS
# certificates returned by this server match one of the fingerprints.
#
# Synapse automatically adds the fingerprint of its own certificate
# to the list. So if federation traffic is handled directly by synapse
# then no modification to the list is required.
#
# If synapse is run behind a load balancer that handles the TLS then it
# will be necessary to add the fingerprints of the certificates used by
# the loadbalancers to this list if they are different to the one
# synapse is using.
#
# Homeservers are permitted to cache the list of TLS fingerprints
# returned in the key responses up to the "valid_until_ts" returned in
# key. It may be necessary to publish the fingerprints of a new
# certificate and wait until the "valid_until_ts" of the previous key
# responses have passed before deploying it.
#
# You can calculate a fingerprint from a given TLS listener via:
# openssl s_client -connect $host:$port < /dev/null 2> /dev/null |
#   openssl x509 -outform DER | openssl sha256 -binary | base64 | tr -d '='
# or by checking matrix.org/federationtester/api/report?server_name=$host
#
#tls_fingerprints: [{"sha256": "<base64_encoded_sha256_fingerprint>"}]

# User Directory configuration
#
# 'enabled' defines whether users can search the user directory. If

# true.
#
# 'search_all_users' defines whether to search all users visible to your HS
# when searching the user directory, rather than limiting to users visible

# User Consent configuration
#
# for detailed instructions, see
# https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/consent_tracking.md
#
# Parts of this section are required if enabling the 'consent' resource under
# 'listeners', in particular 'template_dir' and 'version'.
#
# 'template_dir' gives the location of the templates for the HTML forms.
# This directory should contain one subdirectory per language (eg, 'en', 'fr'),
# and each language directory should contain the policy document (named as
# '<version>.html') and a success page (success.html).
#
# 'version' specifies the 'current' version of the policy document. It defines
# the version to be served by the consent resource if there is no 'v'
# parameter.
#
# 'server_notice_content', if enabled, will send a user a "Server Notice"
# asking them to consent to the privacy policy. The 'server_notices' section
# must also be configured for this to work. Notices will *not* be sent to
# guest users unless 'send_server_notice_to_guests' is set to true.
#
# 'block_events_error', if set, will block any attempts to send events
# until the user consents to the privacy policy. The value of the setting is
# used as the text of the error.
#
# 'require_at_registration', if enabled, will add a step to the registration
# process, similar to how captcha works. Users will be required to accept the
# policy before their account is created.
#
# 'policy_name' is the display name of the policy users will see when registering
# for an account. Has no effect unless `require_at_registration` is enabled.
# Defaults to "Privacy Policy".

# Server Notices room configuration
#
# Uncomment this section to enable a room which can be used to send notices
# from the server to users. It is a special room which cannot be left; notices
# come from a special "notices" user id.
#
# If you uncomment this section, you *must* define the system_mxid_localpart
# setting, which defines the id of the user which will be used to send the
# notices.
#
# It's also possible to override the room name, the display name of the
# "notices" user, and the avatar for the user.

#
#enable_room_list_search: false

# The `alias_creation` option controls who's allowed to create aliases
# on this server.
#
# The format of this option is a list of rules that contain globs that
# match against user_id, room_id and the new alias (fully qualified with
# server name). The action in the first rule that matches is taken,
# which can currently either be "allow" or "deny".
#
# Missing user_id/room_id/alias fields default to "*".
#
# If no rules match the request is denied. An empty list means no one
# can create aliases.
#
# Options for the rules include:
#
#   user_id: Matches against the creator of the alias
#   alias: Matches against the alias being created
#   room_id: Matches against the room ID the alias is being pointed at
#   action: Whether to "allow" or "deny" the request if the rule matches
#
# The default is:
#
#alias_creation_rules:
#  - user_id: "*"
#    alias: "*"
#    room_id: "*"
#    action: allow

# The `room_list_publication_rules` option controls who can publish and
# which rooms can be published in the public room list.
#
# The format of this option is the same as that for
# `alias_creation_rules`.
#
# If the room has one or more aliases associated with it, only one of
# the aliases needs to match the alias rule. If there are no aliases
# then only rules with `alias: *` match.
#
# If no rules match the request is denied. An empty list means no one
# can publish rooms.
#
# Options for the rules include:
#
#   user_id: Matches agaisnt the creator of the alias
#   room_id: Matches against the room ID being published
#   alias: Matches against any current local or canonical aliases
#            associated with the room
#   action: Whether to "allow" or "deny" the request if the rule matches
#
# The default is:
#
#room_list_publication_rules:
#  - user_id: "*"
#    alias: "*"
#    room_id: "*"
#    action: allow
