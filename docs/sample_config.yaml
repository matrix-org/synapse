# This file is maintained as an up-to-date snapshot of the default
# homeserver.yaml configuration generated by Synapse.
#
# It is intended to act as a reference for the default configuration,
# helping admins keep track of new options and other changes, and compare
# their configs with the current default.  As such, many of the actual
# config values shown are placeholders.
#
# It is *not* intended to be copied and used as the basis for a real
# homeserver.yaml. Instead, if you are starting from scratch, please generate
# a fresh config using Synapse by following the instructions in INSTALL.md.

# Configuration options that take a time period can be set using a number
# followed by a letter. Letters have the following meanings:
# s = second
# m = minute
# h = hour
# d = day
# w = week
# y = year
# For example, setting redaction_retention_period: 5m would remove redacted
# messages from the database after 5 minutes, rather than 5 months.

## Server ##

# The public-facing domain of the server
#
# The server_name name will appear at the end of usernames and room addresses
# created on this server. For example if the server_name was example.com,
# usernames on this server would be in the format @user:example.com
#
# In most cases you should avoid using a matrix specific subdomain such as
# matrix.example.com or synapse.example.com as the server_name for the same
# reasons you wouldn't use user@email.example.com as your email address.
# See https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/delegate.md
# for information on how to host Synapse on a subdomain while preserving
# a clean server_name.
#
# The server_name cannot be changed later so it is important to
# configure this correctly before you start Synapse. It should be all
# lowercase and may contain an explicit port.
# Examples: matrix.org, localhost:8080
#
server_name: "SERVERNAME"

# When running as a daemon, the file to store the pid in
#
pid_file: DATADIR/homeserver.pid

# The absolute URL to the web client which /_matrix/client will redirect
# to if 'webclient' is configured under the 'listeners' configuration.
#
# This option can be also set to the filesystem path to the web client
# which will be served at /_matrix/client/ if 'webclient' is configured
# under the 'listeners' configuration, however this is a security risk:

# The public-facing base URL that clients use to access this Homeserver (not
# including _matrix/...). This is the same URL a user might enter into the
# 'Custom Homeserver URL' field on their client. If you use Synapse with a
# reverse proxy, this should be the URL to reach Synapse via the proxy.
# Otherwise, it should be the URL to reach Synapse's client HTTP listener (see
# 'listeners' below).

#
#   bind_addresses: a list of local addresses to listen on. The default is
#       'all local interfaces'.
#
#   type: the type of listener. Normally 'http', but other valid options are:

#       'metrics' (see docs/metrics-howto.md),
#       'replication' (see docs/workers.md).

#
#   x_forwarded: Only valid for an 'http' listener. Set to true to use the
#       X-Forwarded-For header as the client IP. Useful when Synapse is
#       behind a reverse-proxy.
#
#   resources: Only valid for an 'http' listener. A list of resources to host
#       on this port. Options for each resource are:

#           valid resource names.
#
#       compress: set to true to enable HTTP compression for this resource.
#
#   additional_resources: Only valid for an 'http' listener. A map of
#        additional endpoints which should be loaded via dynamic modules.
#
# Valid resource names are:
#
#   client: the client-server API (/_matrix/client), and the synapse admin
#       API (/_synapse/admin). Also implies 'media' and 'static'.
#
#   consent: user consent forms (/_matrix/consent). See

#admin_contact: 'mailto:admin@server.com'

# Global blocking
#
#hs_disabled: false
#hs_disabled_message: 'Human readable reason for why the HS is blocked'

# Monthly Active User Blocking
#
# Used in cases where the admin or server owner wants to limit to the
# number of monthly active users.
#
# 'limit_usage_by_mau' disables/enables monthly active user blocking. When
# enabled and a limit is reached the server returns a 'ResourceLimitError'
# with error type Codes.RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
#
# 'max_mau_value' is the hard limit of monthly active users above which
# the server will start blocking user actions.
#
# 'mau_trial_days' is a means to add a grace period for active users. It
# means that users must be active for this number of days before they
# can be considered active and guards against the case where lots of users
# sign up in a short space of time never to return after their initial
# session.
#
# 'mau_limit_alerting' is a means of limiting client side alerting
# should the mau limit be reached. This is useful for small instances
# where the admin has 5 mau seats (say) for 5 specific people and no
# interest increasing the mau limit further. Defaults to True, which
# means that alerting is enabled
#
#limit_usage_by_mau: false
#max_mau_value: 50
#mau_trial_days: 2
#mau_limit_alerting: false

# If enabled, the metrics for the number of monthly active users will

# Defaults to 'true'.
#
#require_membership_for_aliases: false

# Whether to allow per-room membership profiles through the send of membership
# events with profile information that differ from the target's global profile.
# Defaults to 'true'.
#
#allow_per_room_profiles: false

# How long to keep redacted events in unredacted form in the database. After
# this period redacted events get replaced with their redacted form in the DB.
#
# Defaults to `7d`. Set to `null` to disable.
#
#redaction_retention_period: 28d

# How long to track users' last seen time and IPs in the database.
#
# Defaults to `28d`. Set to `null` to disable clearing out of old rows.
#
#user_ips_max_age: 14d

# Message retention policy at the server level.
#
# Room admins and mods can define a retention period for their rooms using the
# 'm.room.retention' state event, and server admins can cap this period by setting
# the 'allowed_lifetime_min' and 'allowed_lifetime_max' config options.
#
# If this feature is enabled, Synapse will regularly look for and purge events
# which are older than the room's maximum retention period. Synapse will also
# filter events received over federation so that events that should have been
# purged are ignored and not stored again.
#
retention:
  # The message retention policies feature is disabled by default. Uncomment the
  # following line to enable it.
  #
  #enabled: true

  # Default retention policy. If set, Synapse will apply it to rooms that lack the
  # 'm.room.retention' state event. Currently, the value of 'min_lifetime' doesn't
  # matter much because Synapse doesn't take it into account yet.
  #
  #default_policy:
  #  min_lifetime: 1d
  #  max_lifetime: 1y

  # Retention policy limits. If set, and the state of a room contains a
  # 'm.room.retention' event in its state which contains a 'min_lifetime' or a
  # 'max_lifetime' that's out of these bounds, Synapse will cap the room's policy
  # to these limits when running purge jobs.
  #
  #allowed_lifetime_min: 1d
  #allowed_lifetime_max: 1y

  # Server admins can define the settings of the background jobs purging the
  # events which lifetime has expired under the 'purge_jobs' section.
  #
  # If no configuration is provided, a single job will be set up to delete expired
  # events in every room daily.
  #
  # Each job's configuration defines which range of message lifetimes the job
  # takes care of. For example, if 'shortest_max_lifetime' is '2d' and
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' is '3d', the job will handle purging expired events in
  # rooms whose state defines a 'max_lifetime' that's both higher than 2 days, and
  # lower than or equal to 3 days. Both the minimum and the maximum value of a
  # range are optional, e.g. a job with no 'shortest_max_lifetime' and a
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' of '3d' will handle every room with a retention policy
  # which 'max_lifetime' is lower than or equal to three days.
  #
  # The rationale for this per-job configuration is that some rooms might have a
  # retention policy with a low 'max_lifetime', where history needs to be purged
  # of outdated messages on a more frequent basis than for the rest of the rooms
  # (e.g. every 12h), but not want that purge to be performed by a job that's
  # iterating over every room it knows, which could be heavy on the server.
  #
  # If any purge job is configured, it is strongly recommended to have at least
  # a single job with neither 'shortest_max_lifetime' nor 'longest_max_lifetime'
  # set, or one job without 'shortest_max_lifetime' and one job without
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' set. Otherwise some rooms might be ignored, even if
  # 'allowed_lifetime_min' and 'allowed_lifetime_max' are set, because capping a
  # room's policy to these values is done after the policies are retrieved from
  # Synapse's database (which is done using the range specified in a purge job's
  # configuration).
  #
  #purge_jobs:
  #  - longest_max_lifetime: 3d
  #    interval: 12h
  #  - shortest_max_lifetime: 3d
  #    interval: 1d

# See 'ACME support' below to enable auto-provisioning this certificate via
# Let's Encrypt.
#
# If supplying your own, be sure to use a `.pem` file that includes the

# The minimum TLS version that will be used for outbound federation requests.
#
# Defaults to `1`. Configurable to `1`, `1.1`, `1.2`, or `1.3`. Note

# ACME support: This will configure Synapse to request a valid TLS certificate
# for your configured `server_name` via Let's Encrypt.
#
# Note that ACME v1 is now deprecated, and Synapse currently doesn't support
# ACME v2. This means that this feature currently won't work with installs set
# up after November 2019. For more info, and alternative solutions, see
# https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/ACME.md#deprecation-of-acme-v1
#
# Note that provisioning a certificate in this way requires port 80 to be
# routed to Synapse so that it can complete the http-01 ACME challenge.
# By default, if you enable ACME support, Synapse will attempt to listen on
# port 80 for incoming http-01 challenges - however, this will likely fail
# with 'Permission denied' or a similar error.
#
# There are a couple of potential solutions to this:
#
#  * If you already have an Apache, Nginx, or similar listening on port 80,
#    you can configure Synapse to use an alternate port, and have your web
#    server forward the requests. For example, assuming you set 'port: 8009'
#    below, on Apache, you would write:
#
#    ProxyPass /.well-known/acme-challenge http://localhost:8009/.well-known/acme-challenge
#
#  * Alternatively, you can use something like `authbind` to give Synapse
#    permission to listen on port 80.

# List of allowed TLS fingerprints for this server to publish along

#
# Synapse automatically adds the fingerprint of its own certificate
# to the list. So if federation traffic is handled directly by synapse
# then no modification to the list is required.
#
# If synapse is run behind a load balancer that handles the TLS then it
# will be necessary to add the fingerprints of the certificates used by
# the loadbalancers to this list if they are different to the one
# synapse is using.
#
# Homeservers are permitted to cache the list of TLS fingerprints
# returned in the key responses up to the "valid_until_ts" returned in
# key. It may be necessary to publish the fingerprints of a new
# certificate and wait until the "valid_until_ts" of the previous key
# responses have passed before deploying it.

# You can calculate a fingerprint from a given TLS listener via:
# openssl s_client -connect $host:$port < /dev/null 2> /dev/null |
#   openssl x509 -outform DER | openssl sha256 -binary | base64 | tr -d '='
# or by checking matrix.org/federationtester/api/report?server_name=$host
#
#tls_fingerprints: [{"sha256": "<base64_encoded_sha256_fingerprint>"}]


## Federation ##

# Restrict federation to the following whitelist of domains.
# N.B. we recommend also firewalling your federation listener to limit
# inbound federation traffic as early as possible, rather than relying
# purely on this application-layer restriction.  If not specified, the
# default is to whitelist everything.
#
#federation_domain_whitelist:
#  - lon.example.com
#  - nyc.example.com
#  - syd.example.com

# Report prometheus metrics on the age of PDUs being sent to and received from
# the following domains. This can be used to give an idea of "delay" on inbound
# and outbound federation, though be aware that any delay can be due to problems
# at either end or with the intermediate network.
#
# By default, no domains are monitored in this way.
#
#federation_metrics_domains:
#  - matrix.org
#  - example.com

# Uncomment to disable profile lookup over federation. By default, the
# Federation API allows other homeservers to obtain profile data of any user
# on this homeserver. Defaults to 'true'.
#
#allow_profile_lookup_over_federation: false


## Caching ##

# Caching can be configured through the following options.
#
# A cache 'factor' is a multiplier that can be applied to each of
# Synapse's caches in order to increase or decrease the maximum
# number of entries that can be stored.

# The number of events to cache in memory. Not affected by
# caches.global_factor.
#
#event_cache_size: 10K

caches:
   # Controls the global cache factor, which is the default cache factor
   # for all caches if a specific factor for that cache is not otherwise
   # set.
   #
   # This can also be set by the "SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR" environment
   # variable. Setting by environment variable takes priority over
   # setting through the config file.
   #
   # Defaults to 0.5, which will half the size of all caches.
   #
   #global_factor: 1.0

   # A dictionary of cache name to cache factor for that individual
   # cache. Overrides the global cache factor for a given cache.
   #
   # These can also be set through environment variables comprised
   # of "SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR_" + the name of the cache in capital
   # letters and underscores. Setting by environment variable
   # takes priority over setting through the config file.
   # Ex. SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR_GET_USERS_WHO_SHARE_ROOM_WITH_USER=2.0
   #
   # Some caches have '*' and other characters that are not
   # alphanumeric or underscores. These caches can be named with or
   # without the special characters stripped. For example, to specify
   # the cache factor for `*stateGroupCache*` via an environment
   # variable would be `SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR_STATEGROUPCACHE=2.0`.
   #
   per_cache_factors:
     #get_users_who_share_room_with_user: 2.0


## Database ##

# The 'database' setting defines the database that synapse uses to store all of
# its data.
#
# 'name' gives the database engine to use: either 'sqlite3' (for SQLite) or
# 'psycopg2' (for PostgreSQL).
#
# 'args' gives options which are passed through to the database engine,
# except for options starting 'cp_', which are used to configure the Twisted
# connection pool. For a reference to valid arguments, see:
#   * for sqlite: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect
#   * for postgres: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS
#   * for the connection pool: https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool.html#__init__
#
#
# Example SQLite configuration:
#
#database:
#  name: sqlite3
#  args:
#    database: /path/to/homeserver.db
#
#
# Example Postgres configuration:
#
#database:
#  name: psycopg2
#  args:
#    user: synapse_user
#    password: secretpassword
#    database: synapse
#    host: localhost
#    cp_min: 5
#    cp_max: 10

## Logging ##

# A yaml python logging config file as described by
# https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/logging.config.html#configuration-dictionary-schema
#
log_config: "CONFDIR/SERVERNAME.log.config"


## Ratelimiting ##

# Ratelimiting settings for client actions (registration, login, messaging).
#
# Each ratelimiting configuration is made of two parameters:
#   - per_second: number of requests a client can send per second.
#   - burst_count: number of requests a client can send before being throttled.
#
# Synapse currently uses the following configurations:
#   - one for messages that ratelimits sending based on the account the client
#     is using
#   - one for registration that ratelimits registration requests based on the
#     client's IP address.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the client's IP
#     address.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
#     client is attempting to log into.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
#     client is attempting to log into, based on the amount of failed login
#     attempts for this account.
#   - one for ratelimiting redactions by room admins. If this is not explicitly
#     set then it uses the same ratelimiting as per rc_message. This is useful
#     to allow room admins to deal with abuse quickly.
#   - two for ratelimiting number of rooms a user can join, "local" for when
#     users are joining rooms the server is already in (this is cheap) vs
#     "remote" for when users are trying to join rooms not on the server (which
#     can be more expensive)
#   - one for ratelimiting how often a user or IP can attempt to validate a 3PID.
#   - two for ratelimiting how often invites can be sent in a room or to a
#     specific user.
#
# The defaults are as shown below.
#
#rc_message:
#  per_second: 0.2
#  burst_count: 10
#
#rc_registration:
#  per_second: 0.17
#  burst_count: 3

#
#rc_admin_redaction:
#  per_second: 1
#  burst_count: 50
#
#rc_joins:

#    per_second: 0.3
#    burst_count: 10
#  per_user:
#    per_second: 0.003
#    burst_count: 5

# Ratelimiting settings for incoming federation
#
# The rc_federation configuration is made up of the following settings:
#   - window_size: window size in milliseconds
#   - sleep_limit: number of federation requests from a single server in
#     a window before the server will delay processing the request.
#   - sleep_delay: duration in milliseconds to delay processing events
#     from remote servers by if they go over the sleep limit.
#   - reject_limit: maximum number of concurrent federation requests
#     allowed from a single server
#   - concurrent: number of federation requests to concurrently process
#     from a single server
#
# The defaults are as shown below.
#
#rc_federation:
#  window_size: 1000
#  sleep_limit: 10
#  sleep_delay: 500
#  reject_limit: 50
#  concurrent: 3

# Target outgoing federation transaction frequency for sending read-receipts,
# per-room.
#
# If we end up trying to send out more read-receipts, they will get buffered up
# into fewer transactions.
#
#federation_rr_transactions_per_room_per_second: 50



## Media Store ##

# Is the preview URL API enabled?
#
# 'false' by default: uncomment the following to enable it (and specify a
# url_preview_ip_range_blacklist blacklist).
#
#url_preview_enabled: true

# List of IP address CIDR ranges that the URL preview spider is denied
# from accessing.  There are no defaults: you must explicitly
# specify a list for URL previewing to work.  You should specify any
# internal services in your network that you do not want synapse to try
# to connect to, otherwise anyone in any Matrix room could cause your
# synapse to issue arbitrary GET requests to your internal services,
# causing serious security issues.
#
# (0.0.0.0 and :: are always blacklisted, whether or not they are explicitly
# listed here, since they correspond to unroutable addresses.)
#
# This must be specified if url_preview_enabled is set. It is recommended that
# you uncomment the following list as a starting point.
#
#url_preview_ip_range_blacklist:
#  - '127.0.0.0/8'
#  - '10.0.0.0/8'
#  - '172.16.0.0/12'
#  - '192.168.0.0/16'
#  - '100.64.0.0/10'
#  - '192.0.0.0/24'

#  - 'fc00::/7'
#  - '2001:db8::/32'
#  - 'ff00::/8'
#  - 'fec0::/10'

# List of IP address CIDR ranges that the URL preview spider is allowed
# to access even if they are specified in url_preview_ip_range_blacklist.
# This is useful for specifying exceptions to wide-ranging blacklisted
# target IP ranges - e.g. for enabling URL previews for a specific private
# website only visible in your network.
#
#url_preview_ip_range_whitelist:
#   - '192.168.1.1'

# Optional list of URL matches that the URL preview spider is
# denied from accessing.  You should use url_preview_ip_range_blacklist
# in preference to this, otherwise someone could define a public DNS
# entry that points to a private IP address and circumvent the blacklist.
# This is more useful if you know there is an entire shape of URL that
# you know that will never want synapse to try to spider.
#
# Each list entry is a dictionary of url component attributes as returned
# by urlparse.urlsplit as applied to the absolute form of the URL.  See
# https://docs.python.org/2/library/urlparse.html#urlparse.urlsplit
# The values of the dictionary are treated as an filename match pattern
# applied to that component of URLs, unless they start with a ^ in which
# case they are treated as a regular expression match.  If all the
# specified component matches for a given list item succeed, the URL is
# blacklisted.
#
#url_preview_url_blacklist:
#  # blacklist any URL with a username in its URI
#  - username: '*'
#
#  # blacklist all *.google.com URLs
#  - netloc: 'google.com'
#  - netloc: '*.google.com'
#
#  # blacklist all plain HTTP URLs
#  - scheme: 'http'
#
#  # blacklist http(s)://www.acme.com/foo
#  - netloc: 'www.acme.com'
#    path: '/foo'
#
#  # blacklist any URL with a literal IPv4 address
#  - netloc: '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$'

# The largest allowed URL preview spidering size in bytes
#
#max_spider_size: 10M

# A list of values for the Accept-Language HTTP header used when
# downloading webpages during URL preview generation. This allows
# Synapse to specify the preferred languages that URL previews should
# be in when communicating with remote servers.
#
# Each value is a IETF language tag; a 2-3 letter identifier for a
# language, optionally followed by subtags separated by '-', specifying
# a country or region variant.
#
# Multiple values can be provided, and a weight can be added to each by
# using quality value syntax (;q=). '*' translates to any language.
#
# Defaults to "en".
#
# Example:
#
# url_preview_accept_language:
#   - en-UK
#   - en-US;q=0.9
#   - fr;q=0.8
#   - *;q=0.7
#
url_preview_accept_language:

## Captcha ##
# See docs/CAPTCHA_SETUP.md for full details of configuring this.

# This homeserver's ReCAPTCHA public key. Must be specified if
# enable_registration_captcha is enabled.
#
#recaptcha_public_key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"

# This homeserver's ReCAPTCHA private key. Must be specified if
# enable_registration_captcha is enabled.
#
#recaptcha_private_key: "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"

# Uncomment to enable ReCaptcha checks when registering, preventing signup
# unless a captcha is answered. Requires a valid ReCaptcha
# public/private key. Defaults to 'false'.
#
#enable_registration_captcha: true

# The API endpoint to use for verifying m.login.recaptcha responses.
# Defaults to "https://www.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/api/siteverify".

#turn_password: "TURNSERVER_PASSWORD"

# How long generated TURN credentials last
#
#turn_user_lifetime: 1h

# Whether guests should be allowed to use the TURN server.
# This defaults to True, otherwise VoIP will be unreliable for guests.
# However, it does introduce a slight security risk as it allows users to
# connect to arbitrary endpoints without having first signed up for a
# valid account (e.g. by passing a CAPTCHA).
#
#turn_allow_guests: true


## Registration ##
#
# Registration can be rate-limited using the parameters in the "Ratelimiting"
# section of this file.

# Enable registration for new users.
#
#enable_registration: false

# Optional account validity configuration. This allows for accounts to be denied
# any request after a given period.
#
# Once this feature is enabled, Synapse will look for registered users without an
# expiration date at startup and will add one to every account it found using the
# current settings at that time.
# This means that, if a validity period is set, and Synapse is restarted (it will
# then derive an expiration date from the current validity period), and some time
# after that the validity period changes and Synapse is restarted, the users'
# expiration dates won't be updated unless their account is manually renewed. This
# date will be randomly selected within a range [now + period - d ; now + period],
# where d is equal to 10% of the validity period.
#
account_validity:
  # The account validity feature is disabled by default. Uncomment the
  # following line to enable it.
  #
  #enabled: true

  # The period after which an account is valid after its registration. When
  # renewing the account, its validity period will be extended by this amount
  # of time. This parameter is required when using the account validity
  # feature.
  #
  #period: 6w

  # The amount of time before an account's expiry date at which Synapse will
  # send an email to the account's email address with a renewal link. By
  # default, no such emails are sent.
  #
  # If you enable this setting, you will also need to fill out the 'email' and
  # 'public_baseurl' configuration sections.
  #
  #renew_at: 1w

  # The subject of the email sent out with the renewal link. '%(app)s' can be
  # used as a placeholder for the 'app_name' parameter from the 'email'
  # section.
  #
  # Note that the placeholder must be written '%(app)s', including the
  # trailing 's'.
  #
  # If this is not set, a default value is used.
  #
  #renew_email_subject: "Renew your %(app)s account"

  # Directory in which Synapse will try to find templates for the HTML files to
  # serve to the user when trying to renew an account. If not set, default
  # templates from within the Synapse package will be used.
  #
  #template_dir: "res/templates"

  # File within 'template_dir' giving the HTML to be displayed to the user after
  # they successfully renewed their account. If not set, default text is used.
  #
  #account_renewed_html_path: "account_renewed.html"

  # File within 'template_dir' giving the HTML to be displayed when the user
  # tries to renew an account with an invalid renewal token. If not set,
  # default text is used.
  #
  #invalid_token_html_path: "invalid_token.html"

# Time that a user's session remains valid for, after they log in.
#
# Note that this is not currently compatible with guest logins.
#
# Note also that this is calculated at login time: changes are not applied
# retrospectively to users who have already logged in.
#
# By default, this is infinite.
#
#session_lifetime: 24h

# The user must provide all of the below types of 3PID when registering.
#
#registrations_require_3pid:
#  - email
#  - msisdn

# Explicitly disable asking for MSISDNs from the registration
# flow (overrides registrations_require_3pid if MSISDNs are set as required)
#
#disable_msisdn_registration: true

# Mandate that users are only allowed to associate certain formats of

#enable_3pid_lookup: true

# If set, allows registration of standard or admin accounts by anyone who
# has the shared secret, even if registration is otherwise disabled.
#
#registration_shared_secret: <PRIVATE STRING>

# Set the number of bcrypt rounds used to generate password hash.
# Larger numbers increase the work factor needed to generate the hash.
# The default number is 12 (which equates to 2^12 rounds).
# N.B. that increasing this will exponentially increase the time required
# to register or login - e.g. 24 => 2^24 rounds which will take >20 mins.
#
#bcrypt_rounds: 12

# Allows users to register as guests without a password/email/etc, and
# participate in rooms hosted on this server which have been made
# accessible to anonymous users.
#
#allow_guest_access: false

# The identity server which we suggest that clients should use when users log
# in on this server.
#
# (By default, no suggestion is made, so it is left up to the client.
# This setting is ignored unless public_baseurl is also set.)
#
#default_identity_server: https://matrix.org

# Handle threepid (email/phone etc) registration and password resets through a set of
# *trusted* identity servers. Note that this allows the configured identity server to
# reset passwords for accounts!
#
# Be aware that if `email` is not set, and SMTP options have not been
# configured in the email config block, registration and user password resets via
# email will be globally disabled.
#
# Additionally, if `msisdn` is not set, registration and password resets via msisdn
# will be disabled regardless, and users will not be able to associate an msisdn
# identifier to their account. This is due to Synapse currently not supporting
# any method of sending SMS messages on its own.
#
# To enable using an identity server for operations regarding a particular third-party
# identifier type, set the value to the URL of that identity server as shown in the
# examples below.
#
# Servers handling the these requests must answer the `/requestToken` endpoints defined
# by the Matrix Identity Service API specification:

# Defaults to 'true'
#
#enable_3pid_changes: false

# Users who register on this homeserver will automatically be joined
# to these rooms.
#
# By default, any room aliases included in this list will be created
# as a publicly joinable room when the first user registers for the
# homeserver. This behaviour can be customised with the settings below.
# If the room already exists, make certain it is a publicly joinable
# room. The join rule of the room must be set to 'public'.
#
#auto_join_rooms:
#  - "#example:example.com"

# Where auto_join_rooms are specified, setting this flag ensures that the
# the rooms exist by creating them when the first user on the
# homeserver registers.
#
# By default the auto-created rooms are publicly joinable from any federated
# server. Use the autocreate_auto_join_rooms_federated and
# autocreate_auto_join_room_preset settings below to customise this behaviour.
#
# Setting to false means that if the rooms are not manually created,
# users cannot be auto-joined since they do not exist.
#
# Defaults to true. Uncomment the following line to disable automatically
# creating auto-join rooms.
#
#autocreate_auto_join_rooms: false

# Whether the auto_join_rooms that are auto-created are available via
# federation. Only has an effect if autocreate_auto_join_rooms is true.
#
# Note that whether a room is federated cannot be modified after
# creation.
#
# Defaults to true: the room will be joinable from other servers.
# Uncomment the following to prevent users from other homeservers from
# joining these rooms.
#
#autocreate_auto_join_rooms_federated: false

# The room preset to use when auto-creating one of auto_join_rooms. Only has an
# effect if autocreate_auto_join_rooms is true.
#
# This can be one of "public_chat", "private_chat", or "trusted_private_chat".
# If a value of "private_chat" or "trusted_private_chat" is used then
# auto_join_mxid_localpart must also be configured.
#
# Defaults to "public_chat", meaning that the room is joinable by anyone, including
# federated servers if autocreate_auto_join_rooms_federated is true (the default).
# Uncomment the following to require an invitation to join these rooms.
#
#autocreate_auto_join_room_preset: private_chat

# The local part of the user id which is used to create auto_join_rooms if
# autocreate_auto_join_rooms is true. If this is not provided then the
# initial user account that registers will be used to create the rooms.
#
# The user id is also used to invite new users to any auto-join rooms which
# are set to invite-only.
#
# It *must* be configured if autocreate_auto_join_room_preset is set to
# "private_chat" or "trusted_private_chat".
#
# Note that this must be specified in order for new users to be correctly
# invited to any auto-join rooms which have been set to invite-only (either
# at the time of creation or subsequently).
#
# Note that, if the room already exists, this user must be joined and
# have the appropriate permissions to invite new members.
#
#auto_join_mxid_localpart: system

# When auto_join_rooms is specified, setting this flag to false prevents
# guest accounts from being automatically joined to the rooms.
#
# Defaults to true.

#
#macaroon_secret_key: <PRIVATE STRING>

# a secret which is used to calculate HMACs for form values, to stop
# falsification of values. Must be specified for the User Consent
# forms to work.
#
#form_secret: <PRIVATE STRING>

## Signing Keys ##

# Path to the signing key to sign messages with
#
signing_key_path: "CONFDIR/SERVERNAME.signing.key"

# The keys that the server used to sign messages with but won't use
# to sign new messages.
#
old_signing_keys:
  # For each key, `key` should be the base64-encoded public key, and
  # `expired_ts`should be the time (in milliseconds since the unix epoch) that
  # it was last used.
  #
  # It is possible to build an entry from an old signing.key file using the
  # `export_signing_key` script which is provided with synapse.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #"ed25519:id": { key: "base64string", expired_ts: 123456789123 }

# How long key response published by this server is valid for.
# Used to set the valid_until_ts in /key/v2 APIs.
# Determines how quickly servers will query to check which keys
# are still valid.
#
#key_refresh_interval: 1d

# The trusted servers to download signing keys from.
#
# When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.
#
# Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS certificates.
# Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`, which
# will make synapse check that the response is signed by that key.
#
# This setting supercedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old format
# is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated.
#
# 'trusted_key_servers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
# warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
# 'suppress_key_server_warning' to true.
#
# Options for each entry in the list include:
#
#    server_name: the name of the server. required.
#
#    verify_keys: an optional map from key id to base64-encoded public key.
#       If specified, we will check that the response is signed by at least
#       one of the given keys.
#
#    accept_keys_insecurely: a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset,
#       and federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will refuse
#       to start, because this would allow anyone who can spoof DNS responses
#       to masquerade as the trusted key server. If you know what you are doing
#       and are sure that your network environment provides a secure connection
#       to the key server, you can set this to `true` to override this
#       behaviour.
#
# An example configuration might look like:
#
#trusted_key_servers:
#  - server_name: "my_trusted_server.example.com"
#    verify_keys:
#      "ed25519:auto": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmopqr"
#  - server_name: "my_other_trusted_server.example.com"
#
trusted_key_servers:
  - server_name: "matrix.org"

# Uncomment the following to disable the warning that is emitted when the
# trusted_key_servers include 'matrix.org'. See above.
#
#suppress_key_server_warning: true

# The signing keys to use when acting as a trusted key server. If not specified
# defaults to the server signing key.
#
# Can contain multiple keys, one per line.
#
#key_server_signing_keys_path: "key_server_signing_keys.key"


## Single sign-on integration ##

# The following settings can be used to make Synapse use a single sign-on
# provider for authentication, instead of its internal password database.
#
# You will probably also want to set the following options to `false` to
# disable the regular login/registration flows:
#   * enable_registration
#   * password_config.enabled
#
# You will also want to investigate the settings under the "sso" configuration
# section below.

# Enable SAML2 for registration and login. Uses pysaml2.
#
# At least one of `sp_config` or `config_path` must be set in this section to
# enable SAML login.
#
# Once SAML support is enabled, a metadata file will be exposed at
# https://<server>:<port>/_synapse/client/saml2/metadata.xml, which you may be able to
# use to configure your SAML IdP with. Alternatively, you can manually configure
# the IdP to use an ACS location of
# https://<server>:<port>/_synapse/client/saml2/authn_response.
#
saml2_config:
  # `sp_config` is the configuration for the pysaml2 Service Provider.
  # See pysaml2 docs for format of config.
  #
  # Default values will be used for the 'entityid' and 'service' settings,
  # so it is not normally necessary to specify them unless you need to
  # override them.
  #
  sp_config:
    # Point this to the IdP's metadata. You must provide either a local
    # file via the `local` attribute or (preferably) a URL via the
    # `remote` attribute.
    #
    #metadata:
    #  local: ["saml2/idp.xml"]
    #  remote:
    #    - url: https://our_idp/metadata.xml

    # Allowed clock difference in seconds between the homeserver and IdP.
    #
    # Uncomment the below to increase the accepted time difference from 0 to 3 seconds.
    #
    #accepted_time_diff: 3

    # By default, the user has to go to our login page first. If you'd like
    # to allow IdP-initiated login, set 'allow_unsolicited: true' in a
    # 'service.sp' section:
    #
    #service:
    #  sp:
    #    allow_unsolicited: true

    # The examples below are just used to generate our metadata xml, and you
    # may well not need them, depending on your setup. Alternatively you
    # may need a whole lot more detail - see the pysaml2 docs!

  # The default is 15 minutes.
  #
  #saml_session_lifetime: 5m

  # An external module can be provided here as a custom solution to

  #
  user_mapping_provider:
    # The custom module's class. Uncomment to use a custom module.
    #
    #module: mapping_provider.SamlMappingProvider

    # Custom configuration values for the module. Below options are
    # intended for the built-in provider, they should be changed if
    # using a custom module. This section will be passed as a Python
    # dictionary to the module's `parse_config` method.
    #
    config:
      # The SAML attribute (after mapping via the attribute maps) to use
      # to derive the Matrix ID from. 'uid' by default.
      #
      # Note: This used to be configured by the
      # saml2_config.mxid_source_attribute option. If that is still
      # defined, its value will be used instead.
      #
      #mxid_source_attribute: displayName

      # The mapping system to use for mapping the saml attribute onto a
      # matrix ID.
      #
      # Options include:
      #  * 'hexencode' (which maps unpermitted characters to '=xx')
      #  * 'dotreplace' (which replaces unpermitted characters with
      #     '.').
      # The default is 'hexencode'.
      #
      # Note: This used to be configured by the
      # saml2_config.mxid_mapping option. If that is still defined, its
      # value will be used instead.
      #
      #mxid_mapping: dotreplace

  # In previous versions of synapse, the mapping from SAML attribute to
  # MXID was always calculated dynamically rather than stored in a
  # table. For backwards- compatibility, we will look for user_ids
  # matching such a pattern before creating a new account.
  #
  # This setting controls the SAML attribute which will be used for this
  # backwards-compatibility lookup. Typically it should be 'uid', but if
  # the attribute maps are changed, it may be necessary to change it.
  #
  # The default is 'uid'.
  #
  #grandfathered_mxid_source_attribute: upn

  # It is possible to configure Synapse to only allow logins if SAML attributes
  # match particular values. The requirements can be listed under
  # `attribute_requirements` as shown below. All of the listed attributes must
  # match for the login to be permitted.
  #
  #attribute_requirements:
  #  - attribute: userGroup
  #    value: "staff"
  #  - attribute: department
  #    value: "sales"

  # If the metadata XML contains multiple IdP entities then the `idp_entityid`
  # option must be set to the entity to redirect users to.
  #
  # Most deployments only have a single IdP entity and so should omit this
  # option.
  #
  #idp_entityid: 'https://our_idp/entityid'


# List of OpenID Connect (OIDC) / OAuth 2.0 identity providers, for registration
# and login.
#
# Options for each entry include:
#
#   idp_id: a unique identifier for this identity provider. Used internally
#       by Synapse; should be a single word such as 'github'.
#
#       Note that, if this is changed, users authenticating via that provider
#       will no longer be recognised as the same user!
#
#       (Use "oidc" here if you are migrating from an old "oidc_config"
#       configuration.)
#
#   idp_name: A user-facing name for this identity provider, which is used to
#       offer the user a choice of login mechanisms.
#
#   idp_icon: An optional icon for this identity provider, which is presented
#       by clients and Synapse's own IdP picker page. If given, must be an
#       MXC URI of the format mxc://<server-name>/<media-id>. (An easy way to
#       obtain such an MXC URI is to upload an image to an (unencrypted) room
#       and then copy the "url" from the source of the event.)
#
#   idp_brand: An optional brand for this identity provider, allowing clients
#       to style the login flow according to the identity provider in question.
#       See the spec for possible options here.
#
#   discover: set to 'false' to disable the use of the OIDC discovery mechanism
#       to discover endpoints. Defaults to true.
#
#   issuer: Required. The OIDC issuer. Used to validate tokens and (if discovery
#       is enabled) to discover the provider's endpoints.
#
#   client_id: Required. oauth2 client id to use.
#
#   client_secret: oauth2 client secret to use. May be omitted if
#        client_secret_jwt_key is given, or if client_auth_method is 'none'.
#
#   client_secret_jwt_key: Alternative to client_secret: details of a key used
#      to create a JSON Web Token to be used as an OAuth2 client secret. If
#      given, must be a dictionary with the following properties:
#
#          key: a pem-encoded signing key. Must be a suitable key for the
#              algorithm specified. Required unless 'key_file' is given.
#
#          key_file: the path to file containing a pem-encoded signing key file.
#              Required unless 'key' is given.
#
#          jwt_header: a dictionary giving properties to include in the JWT
#              header. Must include the key 'alg', giving the algorithm used to
#              sign the JWT, such as "ES256", using the JWA identifiers in
#              RFC7518.
#
#          jwt_payload: an optional dictionary giving properties to include in
#              the JWT payload. Normally this should include an 'iss' key.
#
#   client_auth_method: auth method to use when exchanging the token. Valid
#       values are 'client_secret_basic' (default), 'client_secret_post' and
#       'none'.
#
#   scopes: list of scopes to request. This should normally include the "openid"
#       scope. Defaults to ["openid"].
#
#   authorization_endpoint: the oauth2 authorization endpoint. Required if
#       provider discovery is disabled.
#
#   token_endpoint: the oauth2 token endpoint. Required if provider discovery is
#       disabled.
#
#   userinfo_endpoint: the OIDC userinfo endpoint. Required if discovery is
#       disabled and the 'openid' scope is not requested.
#
#   jwks_uri: URI where to fetch the JWKS. Required if discovery is disabled and
#       the 'openid' scope is used.
#
#   skip_verification: set to 'true' to skip metadata verification. Use this if
#       you are connecting to a provider that is not OpenID Connect compliant.
#       Defaults to false. Avoid this in production.
#
#   user_profile_method: Whether to fetch the user profile from the userinfo
#       endpoint. Valid values are: 'auto' or 'userinfo_endpoint'.
#
#       Defaults to 'auto', which fetches the userinfo endpoint if 'openid' is
#       included in 'scopes'. Set to 'userinfo_endpoint' to always fetch the
#       userinfo endpoint.
#
#   allow_existing_users: set to 'true' to allow a user logging in via OIDC to
#       match a pre-existing account instead of failing. This could be used if
#       switching from password logins to OIDC. Defaults to false.
#
#   user_mapping_provider: Configuration for how attributes returned from a OIDC
#       provider are mapped onto a matrix user. This setting has the following
#       sub-properties:
#
#       module: The class name of a custom mapping module. Default is
#           'synapse.handlers.oidc_handler.JinjaOidcMappingProvider'.
#           See https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/sso_mapping_providers.md#openid-mapping-providers
#           for information on implementing a custom mapping provider.
#
#       config: Configuration for the mapping provider module. This section will
#           be passed as a Python dictionary to the user mapping provider
#           module's `parse_config` method.
#
#           For the default provider, the following settings are available:
#
#             subject_claim: name of the claim containing a unique identifier
#                 for the user. Defaults to 'sub', which OpenID Connect
#                 compliant providers should provide.
#
#             localpart_template: Jinja2 template for the localpart of the MXID.
#                 If this is not set, the user will be prompted to choose their
#                 own username (see 'sso_auth_account_details.html' in the 'sso'
#                 section of this file).
#
#             display_name_template: Jinja2 template for the display name to set
#                 on first login. If unset, no displayname will be set.
#
#             email_template: Jinja2 template for the email address of the user.
#                 If unset, no email address will be added to the account.
#
#             extra_attributes: a map of Jinja2 templates for extra attributes
#                 to send back to the client during login.
#                 Note that these are non-standard and clients will ignore them
#                 without modifications.
#
#           When rendering, the Jinja2 templates are given a 'user' variable,
#           which is set to the claims returned by the UserInfo Endpoint and/or
#           in the ID Token.
#
#   It is possible to configure Synapse to only allow logins if certain attributes
#   match particular values in the OIDC userinfo. The requirements can be listed under
#   `attribute_requirements` as shown below. All of the listed attributes must
#   match for the login to be permitted. Additional attributes can be added to
#   userinfo by expanding the `scopes` section of the OIDC config to retrieve
#   additional information from the OIDC provider.
#
#   If the OIDC claim is a list, then the attribute must match any value in the list.
#   Otherwise, it must exactly match the value of the claim. Using the example
#   below, the `family_name` claim MUST be "Stephensson", but the `groups`
#   claim MUST contain "admin".
#
#   attribute_requirements:
#     - attribute: family_name
#       value: "Stephensson"
#     - attribute: groups
#       value: "admin"
#
# See https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/openid.md
# for information on how to configure these options.
#
# For backwards compatibility, it is also possible to configure a single OIDC
# provider via an 'oidc_config' setting. This is now deprecated and admins are
# advised to migrate to the 'oidc_providers' format. (When doing that migration,
# use 'oidc' for the idp_id to ensure that existing users continue to be
# recognised.)
#

# Enable Central Authentication Service (CAS) for registration and login.
#
cas_config:

  # Defaults to false.
  #
  #enabled: true

  # The URL of the CAS authorization endpoint.
  #
  #server_url: "https://cas-server.com"

  # The attribute of the CAS response to use as the display name.
  #
  # If unset, no displayname will be set.
  #
  #displayname_attribute: name

  # It is possible to configure Synapse to only allow logins if CAS attributes
  # match particular values. All of the keys in the mapping below must exist
  # and the values must match the given value. Alternately if the given value
  # is None then any value is allowed (the attribute just must exist).
  # All of the listed attributes must match for the login to be permitted.

  #required_attributes:
  #  userGroup: "staff"
  #  department: None


# Additional settings to use with single-sign on systems such as OpenID Connect,

    # Directory in which Synapse will try to find the template files below.
    # If not set, or the files named below are not found within the template
    # directory, default templates from within the Synapse package will be used.
    #
    # Synapse will look for the following templates in this directory:
    #
    # * HTML page to prompt the user to choose an Identity Provider during
    #   login: 'sso_login_idp_picker.html'.
    #
    #   This is only used if multiple SSO Identity Providers are configured.
    #
    #   When rendering, this template is given the following variables:
    #     * redirect_url: the URL that the user will be redirected to after
    #       login.
    #
    #     * server_name: the homeserver's name.
    #
    #     * providers: a list of available Identity Providers. Each element is
    #       an object with the following attributes:
    #
    #         * idp_id: unique identifier for the IdP
    #         * idp_name: user-facing name for the IdP
    #         * idp_icon: if specified in the IdP config, an MXC URI for an icon
    #              for the IdP
    #         * idp_brand: if specified in the IdP config, a textual identifier
    #              for the brand of the IdP
    #
    #   The rendered HTML page should contain a form which submits its results
    #   back as a GET request, with the following query parameters:
    #
    #     * redirectUrl: the client redirect URI (ie, the `redirect_url` passed
    #       to the template)
    #
    #     * idp: the 'idp_id' of the chosen IDP.

#
# Additionally, the expiration time ("exp"), not before time ("nbf"),
# and issued at ("iat") claims are validated if present.

ui_auth:
    # The amount of time to allow a user-interactive authentication session
    # to be active.
    #
    # This defaults to 0, meaning the user is queried for their credentials
    # before every action, but this can be overridden to allow a single

## Push ##

push:
  # Clients requesting push notifications can either have the body of
  # the message sent in the notification poke along with other details
  # like the sender, or just the event ID and room ID (`event_id_only`).
  # If clients choose the former, this option controls whether the
  # notification request includes the content of the event (other details
  # like the sender are still included). For `event_id_only` push, it
  # has no effect.
  #
  # For modern android devices the notification content will still appear
  # because it is loaded by the app. iPhone, however will send a
  # notification saying only that a message arrived and who it came from.
  #
  # The default value is "true" to include message details. Uncomment to only
  # include the event ID and room ID in push notification payloads.
  #
  #include_content: false

  # When a push notification is received, an unread count is also sent.
  # This number can either be calculated as the number of unread messages
  # for the user, or the number of *rooms* the user has unread messages in.
  #
  # The default value is "true", meaning push clients will see the number of
  # rooms with unread messages in them. Uncomment to instead send the number
  # of unread messages.
  #
  #group_unread_count_by_room: false


# Spam checkers are third-party modules that can block specific actions

## Rooms ##

# Controls whether locally-created rooms should be end-to-end encrypted by
# default.
#
# Possible options are "all", "invite", and "off". They are defined as:

# * "all": any locally-created room
# * "invite": any room created with the "private_chat" or "trusted_private_chat"
#             room creation presets
# * "off": this option will take no effect
#
# The default value is "off".
#
# Note that this option will only affect rooms created after it is set. It
# will also not affect rooms created by other servers.

    # If you set it true, you'll have to rebuild the user_directory search
    # indexes, see:
    # https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/user_directory.md
    #
    # Uncomment to return search results containing all known users, even if that
    # user does not share a room with the requester.
    #
    #search_all_users: true

    # Defines whether to prefer local users in search query results.
    # If True, local users are more likely to appear above remote users

# User Consent configuration
#
# for detailed instructions, see
# https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/consent_tracking.md
#
# Parts of this section are required if enabling the 'consent' resource under
# 'listeners', in particular 'template_dir' and 'version'.
#
# 'template_dir' gives the location of the templates for the HTML forms.
# This directory should contain one subdirectory per language (eg, 'en', 'fr'),
# and each language directory should contain the policy document (named as
# '<version>.html') and a success page (success.html).
#
# 'version' specifies the 'current' version of the policy document. It defines
# the version to be served by the consent resource if there is no 'v'
# parameter.
#
# 'server_notice_content', if enabled, will send a user a "Server Notice"
# asking them to consent to the privacy policy. The 'server_notices' section
# must also be configured for this to work. Notices will *not* be sent to
# guest users unless 'send_server_notice_to_guests' is set to true.
#
# 'block_events_error', if set, will block any attempts to send events
# until the user consents to the privacy policy. The value of the setting is
# used as the text of the error.
#
# 'require_at_registration', if enabled, will add a step to the registration
# process, similar to how captcha works. Users will be required to accept the
# policy before their account is created.
#
# 'policy_name' is the display name of the policy users will see when registering
# for an account. Has no effect unless `require_at_registration` is enabled.
# Defaults to "Privacy Policy".
#

# Server Notices room configuration
#
# Uncomment this section to enable a room which can be used to send notices
# from the server to users. It is a special room which cannot be left; notices
# come from a special "notices" user id.
#
# If you uncomment this section, you *must* define the system_mxid_localpart
# setting, which defines the id of the user which will be used to send the
# notices.
#
# It's also possible to override the room name, the display name of the
# "notices" user, and the avatar for the user.
#
#server_notices:
#  system_mxid_localpart: notices
#  system_mxid_display_name: "Server Notices"
#  system_mxid_avatar_url: "mxc://server.com/oumMVlgDnLYFaPVkExemNVVZ"
#  room_name: "Server Notices"



# Uncomment to disable searching the public room list. When disabled
# blocks searching local and remote room lists for local and remote
# users by always returning an empty list for all queries.
#
#enable_room_list_search: false

# The `alias_creation` option controls who's allowed to create aliases
# on this server.
#
# The format of this option is a list of rules that contain globs that
# match against user_id, room_id and the new alias (fully qualified with
# server name). The action in the first rule that matches is taken,
# which can currently either be "allow" or "deny".
#
# Missing user_id/room_id/alias fields default to "*".
#
# If no rules match the request is denied. An empty list means no one
# can create aliases.
#
# Options for the rules include:
#
#   user_id: Matches against the creator of the alias
#   alias: Matches against the alias being created
#   room_id: Matches against the room ID the alias is being pointed at
#   action: Whether to "allow" or "deny" the request if the rule matches
#
# The default is:
#
#alias_creation_rules:
#  - user_id: "*"
#    alias: "*"
#    room_id: "*"
#    action: allow

# The `room_list_publication_rules` option controls who can publish and
# which rooms can be published in the public room list.
#
# The format of this option is the same as that for
# `alias_creation_rules`.
#
# If the room has one or more aliases associated with it, only one of
# the aliases needs to match the alias rule. If there are no aliases
# then only rules with `alias: *` match.
#
# If no rules match the request is denied. An empty list means no one
# can publish rooms.
#
# Options for the rules include:
#
#   user_id: Matches against the creator of the alias
#   room_id: Matches against the room ID being published
#   alias: Matches against any current local or canonical aliases
#            associated with the room
#   action: Whether to "allow" or "deny" the request if the rule matches
#
# The default is:
#
#room_list_publication_rules:
#  - user_id: "*"
#    alias: "*"
#    room_id: "*"
#    action: allow


# Server admins can define a Python module that implements extra rules for
# allowing or denying incoming events. In order to work, this module needs to
# override the methods defined in synapse/events/third_party_rules.py.
#
# This feature is designed to be used in closed federations only, where each
# participating server enforces the same rules.

## Opentracing ##

# These settings enable opentracing, which implements distributed tracing.
# This allows you to observe the causal chains of events across servers
# including requests, key lookups etc., across any server running
# synapse or any other other services which supports opentracing
# (specifically those implemented with Jaeger).
#
opentracing:
    # tracing is disabled by default. Uncomment the following line to enable it.
    #
    #enabled: true

    # The list of homeservers we wish to send and receive span contexts and span baggage.
    # See docs/opentracing.rst
    # This is a list of regexes which are matched against the server_name of the
    # homeserver.
    #
    # By default, it is empty, so no servers are matched.
    #
    #homeserver_whitelist:
    #  - ".*"

    # Jaeger can be configured to sample traces at different rates.
    # All configuration options provided by Jaeger can be set here.
    # Jaeger's configuration mostly related to trace sampling which
    # is documented here:
    # https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.13/sampling/.

## Workers ##

# Disables sending of outbound federation transactions on the main process.
# Uncomment if using a federation sender worker.
#
#send_federation: false

# It is possible to run multiple federation sender workers, in which case the
# work is balanced across them.
#
# This configuration must be shared between all federation sender workers, and if
# changed all federation sender workers must be stopped at the same time and then
# started, to ensure that all instances are running with the same config (otherwise
# events may be dropped).
#
#federation_sender_instances:
#  - federation_sender1

# When using workers this should be a map from `worker_name` to the
# HTTP replication listener of the worker, if configured.
#
#instance_map:
#  worker1:
#    host: localhost
#    port: 8034

# Experimental: When using workers you can define which workers should
# handle event persistence and typing notifications. Any worker
# specified here must also be in the `instance_map`.
#
#stream_writers:
#  events: worker1
#  typing: worker1

# The worker that is used to run background tasks (e.g. cleaning up expired
# data). If not provided this defaults to the main process.
#
#run_background_tasks_on: worker1

# A shared secret used by the replication APIs to authenticate HTTP requests
# from workers.

# Configuration for Redis when using workers. This *must* be enabled when
# using workers (unless using old style direct TCP configuration).
#
redis:
  # Uncomment the below to enable Redis support.
  #
  #enabled: true

  # Optional host and port to use to connect to redis. Defaults to
  # localhost and 6379
  #
  #host: localhost
  #port: 6379

  # Optional password if configured on the Redis instance
  #
  #password: <secret_password>
