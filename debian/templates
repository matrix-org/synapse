Template: matrix-synapse/server-name
Type: string
_Description: Name of the server:
 The name that this homeserver will appear as, to clients and other
 servers via federation. This is normally the public hostname of the
 server running synapse, but can be different if you set up delegation.
 Please refer to the delegation documentation in this case:
 https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/delegate.md.

Template: matrix-synapse/report-stats
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Report anonymous statistics?
 Developers of Matrix and Synapse really appreciate helping the
 project out by reporting anonymized usage statistics from this
 homeserver. Only very basic aggregate data (e.g. number of users)
 will be reported, but it helps track the growth of the Matrix
 community, and helps in making Matrix a success, as well as to
 convince other networks that they should peer with Matrix.
 .
 Thank you.
