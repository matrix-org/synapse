      # The `git push` above does not trigger CI on the dependabot PR.
      #
      # By default, workflows can't trigger other workflows when they're just using the
      # default `GITHUB_TOKEN` access token. (This is intended to stop you from writing
      # recursive workflow loops by accident, because that'll get very expensive very
      # quickly.) Instead, you have to manually call out to another workflow, or else
      # make your changes (i.e. the `git push` above) using a personal access token.
      # See
      # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow
      #
      # I have tried and failed to find a way to trigger CI on the "merge ref" of the PR.
      # See git commit history for previous attempts. If anyone desperately wants to try
      # again in the future, make a matrix-bot account and use its access token to git push.

  # THIS WORKFLOW HAS WRITE PERMISSIONS---do not add other jobs here unless they
  # are sufficiently locked down to dependabot only as above.
