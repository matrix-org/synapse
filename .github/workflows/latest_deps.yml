# People who are freshly `pip install`ing from PyPI will pull in the latest versions of
# dependencies which match the broad requirements. Since most CI runs are against
# the locked poetry environment, run specifically against the latest dependencies to
# know if there's an upcoming breaking change.
#
# As an overview this workflow:
# - checks out develop,
# - installs from source, pulling in the dependencies like a fresh `pip install` would, and 
# - runs mypy and test suites in that checkout.
#
# Based on the twisted trunk CI job.
