       <p>Congratulations!</p>
       <p>Your Synapse server is listening on this port and is ready for messages.</p>
       <p>To use this server you'll need a client - e.g. one of
       <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#clients">this list of Matrix clients</a>.</p>
       <p>You can find (federated) rooms that might be of interest to you on
       <a href="https://view.matrix.org/">view.matrix.org</a>.</p>
       <p>Or you just start creating your own rooms with your friends.</p>
       <p>Welcome to the Matrix universe :)</p>
